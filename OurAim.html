    <main>
        <p>For a capstone project that tackles a real-life problem using Java, consider developing a <b>Waste Management and Recycling Information System</b>. This project addresses the critical issue of waste management efficiency and promotes environmental sustainability. It could be particularly relevant for municipalities, environmental agencies, or community organizations seeking to enhance waste management practices.</p>
        <h2>Project Title:</h2>
        <p> EcoWaste - A Smart Waste Management and Recycling Information System</p>
        <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
        <p>EcoWaste aims to improve waste collection and recycling processes through a Java-based system that connects households, waste collectors, and recycling centers. The platform will provide real-time information on waste collection schedules, recycling guidelines, and the location of recycling centers. It also educates users on waste segregation and encourages recycling through community engagement.</p>
        <h3>1. User Registration and Profiles:-</h3>
        <p><li>Different user roles for households, waste collectors, and recycling centers, each with tailored functionalities.</li></p>

        <h3>2. Waste Collection Scheduling:-</h3>
        <p><li>Allow households to schedule waste pickups and notify waste collectors of upcoming pickups. Implement a calendar view for both collectors and households to manage and view schedules.</li></p>

        <h3>3. Recycling Information and Guidelines:-</h3> 
        <p><li>A database of information on how to properly segregate and recycle different types of waste. This could include educational materials, videos, or infographics.</li></p>

        <h3>4. Location Services:-</h3>
        <p><li>Integrate Google Maps API to help users locate nearby recycling centers, drop-off points, and to optimize routes for waste collectors.</li></p>

        <h3>5. Awareness:-</h3>
        <p><li>We have created a separate Section to spread awareness regarding Waste Management & we have added many articles, video link, and discuss about the steps taken by the government for waste management.</li></p>

        <h2>Technologies and Tools:-</h2>

        <h3>-Backend:-</li></h3> 
        <P><li>we have used Java backend services, For the backend development.</li></P>
        <h3>-Database:-</h3> 
        <P><li>MySQL or MongoDB for storing user data, schedules, and recycling information.</li></P>
        <h3>-Frontend:-</h3> 
        <P><li>Frontend is designed using HTML 5, CSS & JavaScript.</li></P>
        <h3>-APIs:-</h3> 
        <P><li>Google Maps for location services and potentially other environmental data sources for recycling guidelines.</li></P>

        <h2>Challenges and Learning Outcomes:-</h2>

        <p><li>Designing a system that caters to multiple user roles with different needs and permissions.</li></p>
        <p><li>Integrating external APIs and handling real-time data for scheduling and location services.</li></p>
        <p><li>Developing an engaging and educational user interface that promotes environmental sustainability.</li></p>
        <p><li>Working with complex database schemas to handle scheduling, user interactions, and analytics.</li></p>

        <h2>Conclusion:-</h2>
        <p><li>This project allows you to address a significant environmental issue through technology, providing a platform that could lead to tangible improvements in waste management and recycling efforts. It encompasses full-stack development, from database management and backend logic to user interface design, making it a comprehensive and impactful capstone project.</li></p>
